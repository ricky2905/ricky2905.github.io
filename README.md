## Contents

This repository contains all the homework assignments for the course. Each homework has its own dedicated folder within this master repository.

### Homework 1

**Title:** *What is Statistics, and Why Can It Be Useful for Cybersecurity?*

In an era where cybersecurity is more critical than ever, statistics plays a key role in identifying threats, analyzing patterns, and preventing attacks before they occur. Homework 1 explores these concepts in detail, demonstrating how statistical methods can transform raw data into actionable insights for cybersecurity.

### Homework 2

**Title** *Datasets in Statistics and Cybersecurity*

The page explains the key roles of datasets—structured, unstructured, and semi-structured—along with essential management practices and core statistical concepts and formulas applied in cybersecurity.
It also features a practical example using the KDD Cup '99 dataset and includes a web tool for the Caesar cipher, enabling generation, brute-force decryption, and frequency/chi-squared analysis with charts and CSV download, plus code and SQL query examples.

### Homework 3 

**Title:** *RSA (toy) — Letter-level encryption and statistical recovery*  

Toy implementation of textbook RSA for letters and an interactive demo showing how frequency analysis and heuristic search can recover plaintext in small message spaces.

### Homework 4

**Title:** *Law of Large Numbers — Simulation and Visualization*  

Interactive simulations and theoretical notes illustrating the Weak/Strong Law of Large Numbers, empirical convergence of sample frequencies, and comparison with theoretical variance.

### Homework 5

**Title:** *Measures of Location — Survey, Theory, and Practical Use*

A web page presenting key measures of location and dispersion, including the mean, median, mode, and their variants (geometric, harmonic, RMS), along with spread measures such as range, variance, standard deviation, IQR, MAD, and CV. It features formal definitions and formulas (population vs. sample), practical guidance on usage and limitations, worked examples, reproducible code, reporting recommendations, and an interactive toolkit with histogram and boxplot diagnostics.

### Homework 6

**Title:** *Mean and Variance Simulator - Numerical Stability and Algorithm Comparison*

Interactive simulator that computes sample mean and variance using numerically stable Welford (online) updates and a naive incremental sum/sumsq comparator. Visualizations include cumulative mean with ±1 standard error, running sample variance, and histogram with KDE. Includes reproducible benchmarks, a catastrophic-cancellation demo, and automated merge-based tests to demonstrate numerical stability, efficiency, and how to aggregate statistics in parallel.
