## Contents

This repository contains all the homework assignments for the course. Each homework has its own dedicated folder within this master repository.

### Homework 1

**Title:** *What is Statistics, and Why Can It Be Useful for Cybersecurity?*

In an era where cybersecurity is more critical than ever, statistics plays a key role in identifying threats, analyzing patterns, and preventing attacks before they occur. Homework 1 explores these concepts in detail, demonstrating how statistical methods can transform raw data into actionable insights for cybersecurity.

### Homework 2

**Title** *Datasets in Statistics and Cybersecurity*

The page explains the key roles of datasets—structured, unstructured, and semi-structured—along with essential management practices and core statistical concepts and formulas applied in cybersecurity.
It also features a practical example using the KDD Cup '99 dataset and includes a web tool for the Caesar cipher, enabling generation, brute-force decryption, and frequency/chi-squared analysis with charts and CSV download, plus code and SQL query examples.

### Homework 3 

**Title:** *RSA (toy) — Letter-level encryption and statistical recovery*  

Toy implementation of textbook RSA for letters and an interactive demo showing how frequency analysis and heuristic search can recover plaintext in small message spaces.

### Homework 4

**Title:** *Law of Large Numbers — Simulation and Visualization*  

Interactive simulations and theoretical notes illustrating the Weak/Strong Law of Large Numbers, empirical convergence of sample frequencies, and comparison with theoretical variance.

### Homework 5

**Title:** *Measures of Location — Survey, Theory, and Practical Use*

A page summarizing the main measures of location—including arithmetic mean, median, mode, geometric mean, harmonic mean, RMS, power/Lehmer means, trimmed/Winsorized means, and M-estimators. It provides formulas, practical guidance on when to use each measure, notes on robustness, and a few illustrative numerical examples.

### Homework 6

**Title:** *Mean and Variance Simulator - Numerical Stability and Algorithm Comparison*

Web page that computes sample mean and variance using two-pass, Welford (online), and naive algorithms. It visualizes cumulative mean, running variance, and histogram with kernel density estimate, and includes benchmarks comparing speed and numerical accuracy across different data distributions.
