## What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is a discipline that deals with the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It helps transform raw data into actionable information for making decisions under uncertainty.[1]

Two main macro-areas of statistics are: 

1. **Descriptive statistics**: synthesizes and describes the characteristics of a set of data (mean, variance, quantiles, distributions, graphs, etc.).
2. **Inferential statistics**: uses samples to draw conclusions about a larger population, estimate parameters, test hypotheses, and quantify uncertainty. 

Statistics are widely applied in many areas, including cybersecurity, where they can be used to model risks, analyze anomalous events in logs, estimate the probability of attack, and more.[2]

## Why Statistics Can Be Useful for Cybersecurity

Every day we use statistical concepts without even realizing it: from medicine to business to social sciences, statistics allows us to make decisions based on facts rather than intuition.  

In the digital age, where data are constantly generated by networks, servers, and devices, statistics has become a key pillar of cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity experts must analyze massive volumes of information (login attempts, data transfers, system logs, network traffic) to detect anomalies and prevent potential attacks. Without statistical reasoning, distinguishing between normal activity and a potential breach would be nearly impossible.

## Example

Imagine a company using an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to monitor its network. This system constantly collects data such as user access logs, file transfers, and device connections. Through statistics, analysts can compute average daily accesses per user and establish what is considered “normal” behavior.

If a user suddenly logs in far more frequently than usual or transfers large amounts of data to an external server, this deviation from the baseline is automatically flagged as suspicious activity.

Statistical tools also play a crucial role in predictive cybersecurity. By analyzing historical patterns, it is possible to forecast potential threats and estimate the likelihood of future incidents. This approach transforms security from a reactive process, responding to an incident after it happens, to a proactive discipline that anticipates attacks before they occur.  

This illustrates how statistical analysis supports early detection, informed decisions, and optimized resource allocation.

## Advantages of Using Statistics in Cybersecurity

1. **Early threat detection**: Statistical analysis helps identify anomalies in your data, making it easier to detect potential attacks early.[3]
2. **Informed decisions**: Provides a solid foundation for making strategic decisions, reducing uncertainty.[4]
3. **Resource optimization**: Helps focus security efforts where they are needed most, improving operational efficiency.[3]

## Disadvantages of Using Statistics in Cybersecurity

1. **Data quality dependency**: Incorrect analyses can result from incomplete or inaccurate data.[3]
2. **False positives**: Statistical analysis can generate unwarranted alarms, increasing the workload of experts.[4]
3. **Computational complexity**: Some statistical methods require significant computational resources, slowing down decision-making processes.[5]

## Conclusion

Mastering statistics is not just a skill for mathematicians; it is a fundamental competence for cybersecurity professionals.  
It enables data-informed decision making, early anomaly detection, and effective digital resilience in an increasingly complex cyber landscape.
