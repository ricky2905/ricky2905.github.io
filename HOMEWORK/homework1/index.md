## What is Statistics?

Statistics is the branch of mathematics that studies how to collect, analyze, interpret, and present data.  

It provides tools to understand patterns, make predictions, and make decisions under uncertainty.  

**In cybersecurity**, statistics transforms raw data into actionable insights.

## Why Statistics is Useful in Cybersecurity

Modern cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated. Companies collect massive streams of data: login attempts, file transfers, logs, network traffic, etc.  

Statistical analysis is essential to detect anomalies or potential security incidents.

### Key Applications

**Anomaly Detection:**  
Detect deviations from normal behavior, e.g., unusual login patterns or data transfers.

**Threat Prediction:**  
Use historical data to forecast possible attacks.

**Resource Optimization:**  
Prioritize alerts and focus on critical incidents.

**Risk Assessment:**  
Quantify breach probabilities and expected impacts for informed decisions.
